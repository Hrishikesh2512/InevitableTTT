# InevitableTTT

A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe powered by a pure Minimax algorithm.

- Matrix-only logic
- No graphics, no randomness
- Human input via 1–9 board mapping
- AI never loses (best case: draw)

This project shows how perfect play emerges from logic alone.

Run:
python tictactoe.py

If you lose, it’s mathematics.
